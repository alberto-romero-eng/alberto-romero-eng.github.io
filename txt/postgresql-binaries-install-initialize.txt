(1) Enter in "bin" directory
cd C:\opt\postgresql\postgresql-9.6.24\bin\



(2) Check version, help
postgres -V
postgres --version
postgres --help



(2) Initialize cluster (only once)
NOTE: folder creation should be allowed by operating system
initdb -D /opt/postgresql/postgresql-9.6.24/data



(3) Initialize server daemon
NOTE: log file creation should be allowed by operating system
pg_ctl -D <cluster-directory> -l <logfile> start
pg_ctl -D /opt/postgresql/postgresql-9.6.24/data -l /opt/postgresql/postgresql-9.6.24/log/pgdb.log start

NOTE: set environment variable %PGDATA% to skip "-D <cluster-directory>" parameter
set PGDATA=\opt\postgresql\postgresql-9.6.24\data
echo %PGDATA%
pg_ctl -l /opt/postgresql/postgresql-9.6.24/log/pgdb.log start



(*) Reference, server daemon status, restart, stop
NOTE: set environment variable %PGDATA% to skip "-D <cluster-directory>" parameter
set PGDATA=\opt\postgresql\postgresql-9.6.24\data
echo %PGDATA%

pg_ctl [-D <cluster-directory>] [status|restart|stop]
pg_ctl -D /opt/postgresql/postgresql-9.6.24/data status

pg_ctl status
pg_ctl restart
pg_ctl stop



(4) First login to postgresql DB and admin configuration

Check in "pg_hba.conf" (cluster folder) this configuration, allowing access without password, restart server if necessary:
# IPv4 local connections:
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust

Login from cmd:
psql postgres
psql -d postgres -h 127.0.0.1

Once into "psql" client console, check connection info and config postgres superuser:
\conninfo
create role postgres with superuser ;
alter user postgres with encrypted password '1234';
alter role postgres with login ;

Exit "psql" client console:
\q



(5) Restart server, check postgres superuser password access

Change "pg_hba.conf" to require password, restart server (pg_ctl restart):
# IPv4 local connections:
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

Check "postgres" superuser configuration, password should be required:
psql -d postgres -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432

Once into "psql" console, check connection info:
\conninfo
\q
