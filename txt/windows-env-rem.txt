(1) Reminders:
= = = = = = = =

(1.1) ACTIVEMQ_HOME bug, use unix folder separator ('/').

(1.2) MAVEN_HOME requires also M2_HOME and MVN_HOME, all with same value.

(1.3) RABBITMQ_HOME requires also RABBITMQ_SERVER, both with same value.

(1.4) Note that %PYTHONHOME% does not use '_'.

(1.5) It's ok to reference variables in %PATH%, see (3).

(1.6) All variables referenced in %PATH% must contain a value (should not refer to other variables), see (2).

(1.7) Despite not forbidden, it's unreliable to use variables referencing other variables in %PATH%.

(1.8) Version specific variables are helpful as as human-reminders (GUI copy-paste), do not reference them in other variables.
