(1) Navigate to regedit.exe in the Start Menu—or hit Windows Key + R and type regedit.exe—and head to this key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT > Directory > Background > shell

(2) Right-click shell and select New > Key. Name the key the application you'd like to add to the context menu.

(3) Now right-click the new key you just made and once again select New > Key. Name the key "command" in all lowercase.

(4) In the new command key folder you just made, double-click the (Default) key located on the right-hand side of the window. In the Value data section, put the path to the executable file for the application you'd like to add to the context menu and hit OK.

(5) Same procedure can be done to add a "Cmd here" entry.
