(1) Gradle can contain several projects, each consisting of several tasks.


(2) File "settings.gradle" for initialization; file "build.gradle" for configuration and execution.


(3) Use de wrapper, it's good idea to alias it:

alias g='./gradlew'

 
(4) Get help about current project ("build.gradle" should exist in current dir):

./gradlew help

./gradlew help projects

Note that "./gradlew --help" is help about command itself, not about project.


(5) Get list of tasks available in current project:

./gradlew tasks


(6) Get help about an specific task:

./gradlew help --task bootRun


(7) Most used commands while testing SpringBoot project:

./gradlew clean

./gradlew build

./gradlew bootRun
