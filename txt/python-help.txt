Install python embeddable - updated: 2022-10-12 07:56
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

(1) Windows 10, disable python "app execution alias" using GUI menu.

(2) Download zip containing embeded python, extract files in appropiate folder.

(3) Test installation in folder, run ".\python -V" to check version.

(4) Download "get-pip.py" through "pypi" site, "pip" package, "install" documentation:

(4.1) https://pypi.org/project/pip/  --> then "install" documentation.

(4.2) https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/  --> then download script "get-pip.py".

(4.3) https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py  --> this is the "get-pip.py" script content.

(5) Run ".\python .\get-pip.py", this will add "Scripts" and "Lib" folders.

(6) In "python[V]._pth" file, add line ".\Lib\site-packages".

(7) Test installation: run "python -m pip -V", run ".\Scripts\pip -V" to check version.

(8) Define %PYTHONHOME% env var, containing directly the path to python folder.

Add "%PYTHONHOME%" and "%PYTHONHOME%\Scripts" to %PATH%.  Important:

(8.1) %PYTHONHOME% cannot refer to other variable (bug, it's alphabetically after %PATH%, may cause trouble).

(8.2) Other variables such as %PYTHON_3_10_7_HOME% are encouraged, but just as human-helpers (GUI copy-paste).

(9) Start python console, execute: 

(9.1) "import sys", to import sys module.

(9.2) "sys.path" to check module search paths.

(9.3) "sys.exit()" to exit console.

(10) Rename "python[V]._pth" file to "python[V]._pth.deprecated" (this file prevents correct functioning of "sys.path" in scripts).

(11) Execute (6) again.  This time complete file path is not necessary since %PATH% additions done in (7).

(12) Execute (8) again.

(13) Environment variable %PYTHONPATH% is also an option for module importing.
