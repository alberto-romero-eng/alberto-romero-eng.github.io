VENEZUELAN CORN BREAD (AREPA)
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Components:
corn flour, 1 small-t-cup (120 ml)
water, 1 1/5 small-t-cup (144 ml)

Preparation:
Put water in a bowl, add corn flour progressively, mix with fingers or spoon.
Using hand palms, make a mass sphere, compact it
Mixture should feel hydrated and soft
Let semi-spherical compacted mass rest 10 minutes on plastic sheet
Prepare pot with very thin oil layer, medium heat
After rest, mass should feel less soft and less hydrated
Make arepa shape with hands and plastic sheet
Arepa thickness should be proportional to cooking time, maximum 2 centimeters
Arepa diameter should be proportional to heating pot size
Cook first side on prepared pot, 5 to 10 minutes
Cook second side, 5 to 10 minutes
Let rest 15 minutes in pot or heavy cloth covers

VENEZUELAN WHEAT BREAD (AREPA ANDINA DE TRIGO) - COMPLEX METHOD
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Components:
wheat flour, 2 cups (500 mililiters)
baking powder, 1 spoon (not necessary if wheat flour has "leudant")
sugar, 2 spoons
butter, 2 overloaded spoons
egg, 1 unit
milk, 1/2 cup (125 mililiters)

Preparation:
Warm milk in a pot, add butter and sugar to melt
Put flour in a bowl, add warm milk-butter-sugar and mix
When homogeneous, add egg, keep mixing
When homogeneous, let mass rest 30 minutes in bowl, covered with plastic sheet (prevent humidity to enter or escape)
After rest, put wheat flour on hard still surface and knead mass.
Mass external surface should be dry by using wheat flour; mass interior should be flexible and hydrated.
Knead only 3 minutes, do not develop gluten, make arepa shape.
Principles of diameter and thickness apply, as explained in corn arepa.
Prepare pot with very thin oil layer, medium heat
Cook first side, 5 to 10 minutes
Cook second side, 10 to 8 minutes
Let rest 15 minutes in pot or heavy cloth covers

RICE PUDDING, RICE WITH MILK
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Components:
rice, 1/2 small-t-cup (60 ml)

milk, 1 1/2 small-t-cup (180 ml)
sugar, 1/4 small-t-cup (30 ml)
optional, papelon instead of sugar

Preparation:
Mix rice, water and sugar/papelon into cooking pot; apply high heat, generate boiled sweatened rice
Shake rice if necessary to avoid melting at the pot bottom, keep high heat 3 minutes
Then apply low heat until sweetened rice absorbs almost all water; resulting rice should be under-hydrated
When rice gets almost dry (aprox 10 minutes later), add milk, apply high heat until boiling, keep it 3 minutes, shake mixture
Rest at least 20 minutes, better 2 hours, better yet 24 hours
